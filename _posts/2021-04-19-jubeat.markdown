A personal project where I create a clone of the rhythm game _jubeat_ by Japanese game studio _Bemani_. While _jubeat_ is typically played in an arcade on a panel with a 4x4 grid of buttons, the goal of this project is to play with a Novation Launchpad, a MIDI controller with an 8x8 grid of buttons.

The program reads a file that contains a "map" of when and where to activate the buttons, in time with a specific song.
