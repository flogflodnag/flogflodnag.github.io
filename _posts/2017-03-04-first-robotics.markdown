During high school, from 2013 to 2017, I participated in the local [FIRST Robotics Competition][frc] team, Team 93 NEW Apple Corps. During my time there, the team used _Robot Build and Design_, a custom framework put together by a student, which integrated **agile development** concepts, specifically **scrum** and **kanban**, into the robot build process.

As a part of the two-person Strategy & Scouting corp in 2017, I had two main tasks. The first was to analyze the _2017 Game & Season Manual_, a 135-page rulebook for the 2017 season, and determine what robot design strategy works best with the season's game. This is done in the first week of the season.

After that, corp's focus canges to scouting, where we developed methods and systems to best analyze the performance of every team, including our own, during the competition. After we determined the metrics to analyze each team's robot and match performance, I designed and successfully implemented a system to digitally record the results of each match as they happen. The data my scouting system collected was instrumental in our team winning first place in the 2017 Lake Superior Regional.
