The final project for Security Monitoring & Operations at Fox Valley Technical College. A group project comparing three different security information and event management (SIEM) solutions for a fictional organization, plus documentation covering the installation, configuration, and management of one of the solutions, which I handled.

The three SIEM solutions we investigated were Splunk, SolarWinds Security Event Manager, and Graylog. Taking in consideration the wants and needs of the organization, we decided to recommend Graylog. I then used a network of virtual machines to simulate the organization's environment and documented the installation and configuration procedure as [a seperate report](/assets/graylog/installation-and-configuration-procedure.pdf).
